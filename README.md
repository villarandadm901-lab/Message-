<h1>I Love You ❤️</h1>
<p>
From the moment I met you, my world has been brighter. Every smile, every laugh, every little thing you do fills my heart with joy. Thank you for caring for me so deeply — your love, your attention, and your thoughtfulness mean more to me than words can ever say.
I want you to know how grateful I am for every moment we share. Your kindness, your warmth, and your beautiful soul inspire me to be the best version of myself. I promise to always care for you, to support you, and to make you smile every single day.
You are my everything, my heart, my home. I love you more than words can express, and I will love you forever. ❤️
</p>
